Housley, M.D. (Intermountain WorkMed)\\n\\nFebruary 1, 2023 – Occupational medicine visit – Patient is here for one week follow-up for a fall from being knocked over by a excess laundry stacked in the laundry shoot. She sustained right hip contusion, neck and low back strains. She has attended two visits of physical therapy at Aqua Worx and they have helped somewhat. She has had some nights where she is awakened multiple times because of neck, back or hip pain, but other nights where she is slept quite fitfully. She has done limited short shift work, just a couple hours a day last week, but her employer has asked her to not return until she can do the full job. She typically works just four hours a day a couple of days a week.  Her pain level is 7.  Physical exam: Constitutional: Mild to moderate distress. Neck: Mild to moderate tenderness to palpation or percussion over the spinous processes and paraspinals of the neck, high, near the skull. The patient has diminished range of motion to rotation, flexion, extension, and side bending to about half the expected range, secondary to discomfort.

Housley, M.D. (Intermountain WorkMed)\\n\\nFebruary 13, 2023 – Occupational medicine visit – Patient is here for a 90-day follow-up for a fall including right hip contusion neck strain and low back strain. She reports that about 50% improvement so far and has been attending physical therapy at Aqua Worx where she has had six visits. She has had gradual improvement. She has been off work for most of the last couple of weeks, but just went back for a 4-hour shift yesterday. Her regular work shift is about 5 hours in length. She notes that the therapy seems to be helping quite a bit. She is still mostly sore in the right hip but also having a fair amount of discomfort in her neck. The low back is still sore, but improving probably the fastest. She does feel generally weak and unstable in both legs as if they want to buckle. Pain level is 5/10. Physical exam: Neck: Mild to moderate tenderness to palpation over the paraspinals and trapezius at the base of the skull.  She demonstrates fair range of motion about 60-70% of the excepted range for rotation, flexion, extension, and side bending. Rightward side bending elicits discomfort in the neck and down into the thoracic spine area. She is able to rotate about 60° to either side, limited by discomfort. Extension is also limited by discomfort at about half the expected range. Nevertheless, this is an improvement in her range of motion and symptoms.  Low back: Mild tenderness to palpation or percussion over the paraspinal muscles.  Right hip: Moderate tenderness to palpation over the right gluteal area with some discomfort still about the coccygeal area as well.  Diagnoses: Fall on same level from slipping tripping and stumbling with subsequent striking against unspecific, strain of muscle, fascia and tendon at neck level, sprain of ligaments of lumbar spine, and contusion of right hip. Plan: Continue physical therapy, eight more visits as prescribed, over-the-counter anti-inflammatory such as Ibuprofen or Aleve, ice packs and counter irritants may be helpful.  Work status: Return to modified duty with limitations of 20 pounds lifting limit.  Patient should avoid heavy pushing and heavy pulling.  She should avoid bending or twisting at the waist.  She should avoid use of her hands above shoulder level.  Follow up in two weeks.  \\n\\nKaley McCann, NP-C. (Intermountain WorkMed)\\n\\nFebruary 24, 2023 – Occupational medicine visit – Patient presents today for a follow up on her fall. She reports that she is still only feeling about 50% better at this time. She reports that work is very difficulty and she frequently feels she can only handle about one hour of work before she gets to feeling like her back is hurting worse. She has great difficulty with even the most simple tasks such as washing her dishes. She has been to a Spine Specialist in the past but is worried since she cannot do most therapies they provide. She is wondering about an MRI but reports the pain is in her entire spine.  Physical exam: Bending and twisting slowly with grimace.  Diagnoses: Fall on same level from slipping, tripping and stumbling with subsequent striking against unspecific, strain of muscle, fascia and tendon at neck level, sprain of ligaments of lumbar spine, and contusion of right hip.  Treatment plan: Referred to physiatrist.  Continue physical therapy.  Advised to stay active as possible without increasing pain, may take one to two Tylenol or Ibuprofen every six hours, do stretches/exercises two to three times a day as instructed.

She should avoid use of her hands above shoulder level.  (11)\\n\\nMichael C. Housley, M.D. (Intermountain WorkMed)\\n\\nMarch 2, 2023 – Occupational medicine visit – Patient returns for follow-up for low back and right hip and neck injury. She has attended physical therapy about twelve visits which helps temporarily, but she gets no enduring relief. Each time she resumes work even for five hours her back pain is worse. She is doing about one 4-5-hour shift a week, folding laundry, and that is enough to impede her progress. She also reports that simple tasks at home will bother her back such as standing at the sink to wash dishes even just 5 or 10 minutes will provoke her back. Most the pain is in the lower lumbar area and radiates out into both hips and then off and down the right leg with occasional radiation down to the ankle. She has had a few rare moments of right leg numbness as well, but that does not persist, thankfully. Her right knee is felt weak and unstable underneath her. It is uncertain if it is the knee itself or localized weakness in the leg. She has had some intermittent knee swelling. She gets mild discomfort up in her neck and into the right trapezius, but not radiating down the arm.  Physical exam: Neck: Minimal tenderness to palpation over the spinous process, paraspinals and trapezius. The tenderness that she does have seems to be across the right trapezius reflecting onto the superior aspect of the shoulder. Low back: Mild to moderate tenderness to palpation or percussion over the spinous processes and paraspinal muscles, more so at the belt line. Diagnoses: Fall on same level from slipping, tripping and stumbling with subsequent striking against unspecific, strain of muscle, fascia and tendon at neck level, sprain of ligaments of lumbar spine, and contusion of right hip.  Treatment plan: Follow up with Dr. Carlson on March 16, continue physical therapy as prescribed.  Over-the-counter anti-inflammatories may be helpful.  Warms packs or cold packs may be helpful.  Continue gentle stretching and gentle exercise program at home.  Work status: Return to modified duty with limitations of 20 pounds lifting limit.  Patient should avoid heavy pushing and heavy pulling.  She should avoid bending or twisting at the waist.  She should avoid use of her hands above shoulder level.  Should avoid prolonged standing and prolonged walking.  \\n\\nM.

Special tests of left lower extremity: Ligament stress tests: Positive valgus stress test of left knee with pain.  Meniscus: Unable to assess beyond joint line tenderness due to increased pain and guarding.  Functional testing: Gait: Limited left knee flexion during swing phase, slight left lower extremity circumduction during swing phase of gait.  Stairs: Unable to step up onto left lower extremity more than once due to pain with knee flexion and weightbearing.  The patient reports pain to palpation over (medial, posterior-medial, and anterior-inferior), and pain with knee flexion range of motion and strength testing.  She demonstrates range of motion deficits, strength deficits, and diminished function.  Diagnoses: Left knee pain of unspecified chronicity/acute left knee pain, left knee range of motion deficits and strength deficits.  Impairments noted include decreased range of motion, decreased strength, decreased motor control, and decreased muscular endurance, and increased pain, hypomobility of left patella, abnormal gait, and decreased function.  Megan Culp, therapist states that the patient was guarded throughout meniscus and ligamentous testing so unable to perform full assessment.

Follow-up: Two weeks.\\n\\nAndrew Luke Phillips, M.D. (Redwood Health Center)\\n\\nApril 12, 2023 – Progress note – The patient reports that overall, she has had some steady improvement with her left knee function and pain.  She is ready for a trail to return to work.  She continues to complain of pain primarily in the area of the lateral joint line and the medial aspect of the knee inferior of the patella that she described as burning in quality and radiates superiorly.  The ability to squat has improved and she can squat about 50%, and then the pain is triggered deep in the knee under the patella.  There is some clicking and popping of the knee but no locking or catching.  No instability or buckling.  Currently, she is on FMLA and has an appointment with her primary care physician to do the paperwork to return from FMLA.  She has completed her MRI that was ordered to rule out occult fracture or osteochondral disease but she has not followed up with orthopedics because she had an adverse experience with the provider.  She states that she has been taking both topical and oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories for the past couple of months which help for a little while, but the pain returns.  Physical examination: Body mass index: 39.63.  Left knee: Half dollar-sized area of ecchymosis inferior of the patella which is nontender, no underlying edema.  Tenderness to palpation of the lateral joint line and the iliotibial band noted.  Tenderness to palpation of the Pes anserine, no warmness, or overlying erythema noted.  Patella crepitus appreciated with range of motion.  Range of motion limited in flexion to 30°-45°. She is able to squat halfway down.  Diagnosis: Chronic pain of left knee.  The patient presents with chronic left knee pain due to slip and fall.  Dr. Phillips states that the MRI showed degenerative changes, though it is possible the fall could have aggravated the patient’s preexisting lateral meniscal tear.  There are mild mechanical symptoms, though this is not a feature of her complaints.  He states that there are a combination of MRI findings that may explain some of her anterior pain such as osteochondral defects and patellofemoral arthritis.  He suspects pes anserine bursitis for her medial knee pain.  The patient exhibited incomplete response to oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories therapy for three months.  The patient has made some improvement with physical therapy, as per Dr. Phillips.  Prognosis guarded given prolonged nature of symptoms and underlying comorbidities. Plan: Referral to orthopedics for review of MRI and consider pes anserine injection and knee injection, advised to continue physical therapy, recommended Ibuprofen as needed, this may be substituted with topical Voltaren, and prescribed Tylenol 500mg.

It was witnessed by Teodona V. Rivera. She reported the incident to the supervisor the same day. However, she declined the medical help and said she would go to the clinic on her own with her family member. There were no visible injuries, but she walked with a limp. The supervisor stated that the accident occurred as the employee was driving the truck fast in the encore Valet Driveway and hit both sides of the driveway. She was advised to slow down the vehicle and the supervisor issued an order to a work engineer to do an inspection of the dump truck and check all the areas. \\n\\nOctober 19, 2019:  Guest/ Employee voluntary statement:  Ms. Charles stated that she was driving a pickup truck. She had informed her manager about the flat tire and loose brakes earlier, but no action was taken. On the day of the incident, she was driving the truck, but she was unable to stop it, as the brakes were not good. She had reported it five times before the accident to fix it. Currently she is in pain.\\n\\nOctober 19, 2019:  Guest/ Employee voluntary statement:  Ms. Rivera stated that she was driving behind Ms. Charles and when she was going down towards the valet garage at the encore main entrance, she heard a big noise and banging. So, she stopped and looked back. She noticed that Ms. Charles truck had hit the wall and it was moving haphazardly. Therefore, she came down immediately to check on her. Ms. Charles was trying to drive the truck away from the scene. She told her to leave it and then immediately informed her manager.\\n\\nOctober 19, 2019:  Written statement regarding incident:  Ms. Arroyo stated that on October 19, 2019, morning, PAD Manager Eduardo Cordova informed her that Employee Erilene Charles had an accident while she was driving the Dump Truck 101 and she was sent to Concentra around 7am. Around 2:20 p.m., she got a call from the security office to let her know that employee Erilene Charles was back from Concentra and they asked a PAD Manager to get the employee and check with her. She and Manager Yanet Elias went to the Wynn Security Office and asked Erilene how she was feeling, and she said that she had very bad back pain, that nobody in PAD cares about the safety of the employees. She had reported to the manager Eduardo Cordova that vehicle 101 was not working properly in the past two weeks ago and he did not do anything about it. At the same time, she noticed that the employee has the documents that said she was to come back to work on restricted activity but not the envelope with the screening results. She then asked one of the front security officers who informed her that Concentra had not provided the envelope. She informed Erilene that she had to wait for the envelope before making any decisions about the proper procedures of her case, but she declined to wait any longer, because she was in a lot of pain, and walked out stating that she was feeling mistreated and discriminated. The situation escalated to the point that they cannot talk to her, and they noticed that she was filming from her cell phone. She prepared the SPI form and when she tried to present it, she started arguing as she had not done anything wrong and she was involved in an accident and started walking out, refusing to talk to them about the suspension procedure, security officers asked her for her badge, and she refused to give it to them. She kept walking towards the PAD Office saying that she wanted to talk to the PAD Directors. Security officers told her that she was considered a suspended employee and she cannot walk around the property. She did not listen and continued walking, saying that she felt discriminated against because she is black, and do not understand why she was treated as if she stole something. Security officers and PAD Assistant Director-Michael Hudnall walked her all the way out to the Wynn Employee Garage.\\n\\nOctober 19, 2019:  Guest/ Employee voluntary statement:  Ms. Elias stated that she got a call around 2:30 P.M. from the security office to meet the employee Erilene Charles, as she had returned from the hospital. She had an accident in the morning, while driving a truck 101. She asked Erilene about the screening test reports but she had not brought it with her. Therefore, they tried contacting the hospital for the reports and told Erilene to wait for a few minutes. She became upset as she was in pain, declined to wait much longer, and walked away. The security tried to explain to her about the company policy, but she did not listen. She said that she has already reported to the manager Eduardo Cordova about the truck issues two weeks ago. Later she and Susan Arroyo prepared the suspension order and presented it to her. However, she refused to sign it saying that she is going to meet the director at PAD office. She videotaped the incident stating that as she was black, they were mistreating her as if she had stolen something and she walked away. Later director Michael Hudnall came and managed the situation.\\n\\nOctober 19, 2019:  Guest/ Employee voluntary statement: Mr. Hudnall stated that on October 19, 2019, approximately at 3:15 p.m. Susana Arroyo called him to tell that Erilena Charles was not understanding why she was being suspended and refusing to turn in her ID and name badge. Susana told him that they were in the basement near Wynn Housekeeping. When he got to the scene Susana was there with PAD manager Yanat Elias, Security and a member of Corporate Investigations. As they walked, Erilene out she stopped by the PAD offices door and asked to see the Director. He informed her that he was not here today, but she could talk to him. She looked confused, he then asked her if she knew who he was, she replied to no. He explained that he was her Assistant Director, and then they continued walking towards the employee entrance. While walking Erilene towards the employee entrance she kept saying that she did nothing wrong and that they were doing this because she was black, she also mentioned a few times that she was being harassed. Erllene spoke with someone on her phone and asked to video record him and the Corporate Investigator as they walked her out to the Wynn employee pick up area. He also informed her not to come for her shift tonight and to wait until they call her to let her know what is going to happen.\\n\\nOctober 19, 2019:  Public areas department statement:  Mr. Cordova stated that on October 19, 2019, Calvin received a call over the radio from Teodora Rivera around 6:15 a.m. She notified Calvin that they needed him at the Encore Valet down ramp. At that time, he Calvin, and Maria L, were in the Encore PAD office. Calvin then headed over to the scene and upon arrival; he reached out to him to let him know that Erilene Charles was involved in an accident at the Encore Valet down ramp. When he arrived at the scene at approximately 6:20 a.m., he noticed that the dump truck was on the curve crashed against the right side of the down ramp. He then approached Erilene and asked if she was ok. Nevertheless, she ignored him as if he did not ask her anything. He then asked her what happened, and then she began to say that he did not care about her and only cared about what happened and said that they wanted to kill her because they put her in a machine that did not work. He then explained to her that safety was always priority and apologized for her feeling that way. She then stated that she was not in pain at the time, but maybe a couple minutes later she started limping and said she was in pain. Then, she saw security taking photos of the incident and she started recording the incident as well. While recording the incident she was walking perfectly fine and then started limping again. She stated that the left rear tire was flat and that the brakes had not been working, which she had informed to the management. He stated that he had not received any reports stating that the tires were flat on that specific dump truck. When he asked whom, she reported, she just kept saying management. Once security had conducted their reports, they requested him to deliver the dump truck to the security bike cage, which is in the Wynn Guest Garage. During the drive over to the bike cage, he stepped on the brakes on several occasions to ensure they were working properly. However, he did not notice any issues with the brakes. Upon arrival, security requested an inspection checklist, which was provided later by the department engineers. He then returned to the office and sent out an email to upper management regarding the incident. \\n\\nOctober 19, 2019:  Guest/ Employee voluntary statement:  Mr. Warren stated that on Saturday, October 19, 2019, around 6:15 a.m. he got an as soon as possible call VIA radio from Teodora Rivera to come to Valet area on the Encore side.

Security Shift Manager Ken had arrived on scene and asked what happened. He and Marle stated they did not know. He notified Shift Manager Eddie VIA Cell call and asked Teodora to explain the incident. She stated that she was in front of her, she heard Ms.Erilene screaming along with a loud crash and immediately she called them on the radio. When he was there Ms. Charles stated that the dump truck had a flat tire, and the brakes were not good. Security asked Ms. Charles does she needed emergency medical services, she declined stating that she does not trust them or doctors as they might hurt her, and she needed her family member presence while examining. As the Security investigated the Dump truck taking pictures and getting statements, Ms. Charles took out her cell phone and started recording everybody on scene. When the Security Manager Ken asked Ms. Charles was, she fine, she then stated that she was in pain and started limping. She also complained of back pain. They asked the PAD Manager Eddie to take the Dump Truck to Security Bike Team Office. Mr. Warren stated that in the Workmen Comp Paperwork, she had stated that the dump truck was not working properly, and she did not feel good. Then she called her family member and said Wynn was trying to kill her. She stated that she could not write her statement out as her hands, legs, and back hurt and she could not see the words on the paper. Ms. Charles asked Security officer Joel to provide some glasses as the words were blurry. In addition, Ms. Charles never reported to him or any other Managers about any breaks on any PAD vehicles.

She could not have any flexion or extension of spine, but she could sit, she used a cane today and had trouble making three steps. She says she always must have support either of cane or walker.  Impression: Industrial Injury related- Lumbar sprain, and leg sprain. Non-motor vehicle related-Mild lumbar spondylosis.  Plan: Recommended MRI of lumbar spine.  Dr. Lee after reviewing the records stated that she was not a candidate for surgery and would be benefitted with additional physical therapy. Recommended to follow-up with psychiatry. \\n\\nMay 28, 2020:  Javier Torres, M.D.:  Patient visit note:  The patient is complaining of pain in both legs and rated it as 8/10. She also has constant pain in the lower back, that radiates to legs, 8/10. Complains of headaches, with 8/10 score. She has not participated with physical therapy. she states that she got upset with physical therapy because the physical therapist asked her to clean her own bed. she states her husband is helping her with the home exercises, and she is feeling better with the home exercises, but she continues with pain.

May use walker occasionally. \\n\\nAugust 18, 2020:  Berne Leavitt, P.T.:  Functional Capacity Evaluation:  Summary: The examiner stated that the patient did not make a consistent effort that would have led to valid test results. They are therefore unable to accurately place this woman into a physical demand category. She may very well possess higher functional capabilities than were demonstrated today. The longer she thinks and acts in a less than optimal fashion, the more difficult it will be to return her to gainful employment. She needs to be more responsible in maintaining lumbar spine stability when performing activities below the waist level. Objects should be handled as close to the body as possible. This should serve to minimize the risk of legitimate insults to the lumbar spine region. The home physical therapy program is an essential component for injured individuals to maximize overall functional capabilities. However, given invalid test results, they question patient’s level of compliance to perform home program maintenance. \\n\\nAugust 18, 2020:  Javier Torres, M.D.:  Addendum:  Dr. Torres stated that the patient underwent Functional Capacity Evaluation on August 18, 2020, which was invalid. According to the report, Ms. Charles did not give consistent effort. Also, on examination of the right knee, it stated that the right knee revealed 110º flexion with overreaction.

In connection with the claim, he also underwent surgery on his left knee in Long Beach, California, in 2002, as well as surgery on his left shoulder in 2009. He says that his left knee surgery in 2002 cost him $7,000 personally. He sustained a Disney injury in 2009 that resulted from him falling off a truck's back with the desk, and he suffered injuries to his neck, back, shoulders, internal organs, psyche, stomach, knees, and cardio. Mr. Ron served as his lawyer during the claim, and it was settled for a C&R of $287,500.\\n\\nHe recalls that on June 5, 1991, he filed a claim against Universal Studios after suffering a left knee injury while riding a bicycle. In August 2021, he suffered a cut on his left middle finger while working for Paramount Studios, and the issue was not resolved. In 1995, while working at Sony, he sustained a left heel injury when an A-frame fell off his heel.

Since March 2, 2022, he has been receiving $2,179, and in October 2022, they gave him a sizable advance payment. From March 2022 until October or December, he also received $2,700 every two weeks from the State disability fund. In March 2022, he received payment from EDD totaling $60,000. They informed him he could not be eligible for both benefits and that he must pay them back. He was additionally receiving EDD benefits of $2,700 every two weeks from December 2021 through February 2022 for a pulled muscle in his back that occurred in December 2021 prior to his work injury on March 1, 2022. Santa Clarita chiropractor Dr. Herbert confirmed the deponent's eligibility for the benefits.\\n\\nDeponent states that between the middle of December 2021 and March 1, 2022, he took 35 days off of work. He then applied for disability. He had previously spent four to six weeks in 2021 in Studio City, California, working for CBS. He put in a full year's worth of work in 2021, finishing around December 13 or 14.\\n\\nPage no 60-67 – Deponent states that in 1990, he joined Studio Utility Employee Local 724. Prior employments discussed. He has been making frequent trips between Texas and California since 1990 for family-related reasons. According to him, he moved to Texas in March 2022 to live at the home of a friend on Sherman Way, where he remained until August while having all of his medical records sent to Texas. Following the accident, he remained in Texas from March until October 2022, during which he made trips to Dallas to see Concentra. He acknowledges that the checks from AIG/Gallagher are still being sent to her girlfriend's home, where they are then mailed to his Los Angeles Bank of America account. They gave him an EDD payment on a card.\\n\\nPage no 68-75 – Deponent states that he went to a studio warehouse near Hawthorne to offload some walls, and when they freed the wall, the entire section fell on him and pinned him up against the rail in the truck, and the rail was all on the back of his spine and lower back area, and he passed out from the weight. He hurt his knees while attempting to support the weight of the walls. An ambulance transported him to UCLA Hospital in Westwood, Los Angeles, on the same day, where he was treated before being released at a late hour (11:00 or 12:00). He recalls that someone picked him up from UCLA and took him to the studio, where he picked up his car and drove to a hotel called the Hampton Inn. Following a day or two, he received medical attention while staying at the hotel with his friend. He next traveled to his friend's home before heading to Texas.\\n\\nPage 76-79 – Deponent states that the doctors at Concentra and then the doctors on the riverside both told him he couldn't work right now. On Thursday of last week, he had his most recent appointment in Riverside.

Technically, he says, everything is preventing him from returning to work.\\n\\nPage 81-97 - Deponent states that after working out at Gold's Gym, he received a final physical clearance to report for duty in 2018. His right knee and low back haven't responded to any of the surgeries, massages, aquatic exercises, or heat treatments he's received since March 2022. While the shoulder treatments were effective for a while, his right shoulder is now more painful. He experiences headaches from stress twice per week, and he has tried some headache medications that didn't work. He adds that he prepared himself from 2015 to 2018 in order to return to work and that the $1,000 per month he received from social security disability was insufficient for him.\\n\\nSince the accident on March 1, 2022, his left shoulder has improved, while his knees, neck, right shoulder, headaches, and back have all gotten worse. He can't bend to put his shoes on. He was advised to perform some painful at-home and aquatic exercises, but he once tried performing them at the doctor's office. He also wakes up at night due to pain. He also says that since the injury, he has experienced erection problems. Additionally, he has complications with his heart, lungs, and circulatory system for which surgery has been postponed. He claims that when he told Concentra's doctors that his heart hadn't been beating properly ever since the accident, they told him that the problem wasn't related to his job. He states that he visited a heart specialist at UCLA for a checkup before the injury in 2021 and was informed that everything was fine. When he was referred to a specialist at Buena Vista in Burbank, he was asymptomatic. He states he will make a social security application at any time in the future. He adds that his goal was to continue operating this company until he was 67 years old, at which point he could start receiving social security and work without incurring any penalties.\\n\\nPage no 98-109 – Deponent states he wakes up at 7:00am, drives his son to Cleveland High School from Reseda, then drives to Gold's Gym to perform some hygiene tasks because he lives in his car. After eating, he leaves to pick up his son from basketball at 3 o'clock. Deponent then takes his child to a restaurant before dropping him off at his mother's. He quit smoking in 1998 and also gave up marijuana ten years ago, and he also uses the jacuzzi in the evenings to ease his aches and pains. He used to drink vodka and had last checked into a rehab facility in 2000. He also attempts to go for a 10-15min walk each day.\\n\\nPage 110 -113– Deponent states that as the weight of the walls pressed him up against the truck's rails, he felt faint. In November 2022, he also went to see Kravchenko, a chiropractor who represents Dr. Eric Gofnung on Riverside Drive. He adds that there was no concussion, although the wall struck his head.

He reports psychological difficulties with flashbacks and a lot of distress since the accident.  He has difficulty with sleep, feels a lot of anxiety about the accident.  He does not feel that pain is interfering with sleep.  He is not taking pain medications although he has some pain in his hand still from the healing injuries especially around the second digit.  He has been cleared for hand therapy but still has poor flexibility with his intact digits.  He is covering his fourth digit with just a bandaid and has just some simple compression dressings for his other digits.  He does have some skin discoloration and pain associated with different positions (that is more uncomfortable if in a dependent position as opposed to being more up).  He wants to have a better cosmesis so he does not feel awkward in social settings.  He wants to get back to work as well if possible.  Allergies: Cephalexin.  Physical examination: A comprehensive assessment/musculoskeletal examination were done of the amputated and sound limbs.  Pertinent issues: Amputation of left third digit to very proximal aspect of the proximal phalanx.  He has fairly diffuse swelling in his left hand and poor range of motion with dip and pip joints in the intact digits.  He does not tolerate very well passive range of motion of his intact digits.  He can almost fully oppose his thumb.  Eschar is seen at the tip of his left fourth digit.  PROMIS Bank depression score: 50.  Diagnoses: Traumatic amputation of left hand digit.  The patient sustained a work related injury on April 22, 2022, resulting in a left third digit amputation in addition to open fracture and vascular injury of the second digit, and injury to the fourth digit requiring skin grafting to the volar surface.  He is beginning to work with hand therapy but has quite poor range of motion and range of motion tolerance and swelling in his hand.  He desires to utilize prosthesis for both cosmetic and functional goals.  Plan: Continue aggressive hand therapy to achieve as much range of motion and function as possible with his intact digits as well as specialized wound care to facilitate healing of the left fourth digit, consider pre-therapy nerve blocks to allow better tolerance of hand therapy, coordinate with ortho pain service, if insufficient consider referral to pain clinic, continue occupational therapy, referral to outpatient social work at Nielson Rehab Hospital to assist with coping and emotional processing, recommended custom compression therapy, and consultation with Megan and Tim from Handspring Prosthetics to explore prosthetic options for his left third digit amputation and continue working with him to identify reasonable options for prosthetic restoration.

He has continued to work with Dr. Hansen from physical medicine and rehabilitation and he was recommended physical therapy/occupational therapy with a focus to restore range of motion.  He is being treated to manage edema and get fit for prosthesis.  Today, he complains of continued ongoing pain in his left upper extremity specifically localized to his hands.  Currently, he is most worried by a lack of range of motion in his left hand.  He has been working with physical and occupational therapy at the orthopedic center.  Unfortunately, he experiences significant pain while working with his therapist as well as for several hours thereafter.  He reports occasional color changes to his left hand as well as a feeling of warmth in the palm of his left hand.  He rated his average pain level at 8/10.  He complains of sleep disturbance associated with nightmares and flashbacks surrounding his accident.  Currently, he is unable to work and he is seeking disability benefits.  He is frustrated with lack of range of motion.  Overall, he desires to improve his range of motion and possibly return to work.  He also reports significant sleep disturbance and some flashbacks associated with his accident in April.  Promis depression score: 50.  Promis pain interference score: 62.  Past medical history: Essential hypertension, gastroesophageal reflux disease, hypercholesteremia, hyperlipidemia, subclinical hypothyroidism, and diabetes mellitus type-2.

Very limited range of motion noted with flexion of the digits as well as opposition of the thumb and fifth digit.  Trophic changes observed to the skin of the left hand as well as some hair loss.  Neurologic: Limited strength with grip, opposition, splitting of the fingers in the left hand.  Dr. Jackman opined that the pain appears to be neuropathic, mechanical, and nociceptive in nature.  Diagnoses: Traumatic amputation of left hand digit on April 22, 2022, residual symptoms/left hand pain, and complex regional pain syndrome type-1 of left upper extremity.  Plan: Discussed management of the patient’s care with psychologist, x-rays of left hand dated June 30, 2022 reviewed, opioid management report dated July 6, 2022 reviewed, continue working with occupational therapy, prescribed Gabapentin 600mg, recommended stellate ganglion block and the patient consented to proceed with the injection, discussed incorporating some component of mirror therapy with physical therapy, consult with pain psychologist, Dr. Eric Yelsa.  Follow-up: Six to eight weeks.\\n\\nEric Yelsa, Ph.D. (University Orthopaedic Clinic)\\n\\nJuly 6, 2022 – Initial pain management psychology report – The patient was involved in a work-related accident and sustained left hand injury.  He reports that his left hand was caught in a drill press and removed his middle finger and causing degloving of two of his other fingers.  He has undergone reconstructive surgery but is missing his entire middle finger.  His other fingers have noticeable scaring.  He reports that his hand does not have significant pain when not in use.  However, movement or touch aggravates his pain upwards to 10/10 and frequently his hand pain is rated at 8/10 range due to mild movement.  He has been taking Tylenol 650mg for pain management.  He reports throbbing, dull, aching, and tingling sensation in his left hand.  Pain radiates up his wrist when is using his hand.  He is unable to use his left hand for basic activities.  He has no grip strength and cannot open jars, shower, or toilet without assistance.  He would like to return to work but realizes that due to the type of work he was involved that returning may not be an option.  He currently lives with his wife who assists him throughout the day.  He denies negative impact on mood, although he does wake at night from disturbing memories related to his accident.  He is currently on social security disability insurance due to work-related injury.  He was working with Tripoli Construction since one year.  He would like to return to work if possible.  He has worked as a welder all his adult life.  Physical examination: Mental status: He reports trauma flashbacks and memories which prevent him at times from sleeping.  Diagnosis: Chronic pain syndrome.  Dr. Yelsa states that the patient appears to be functioning with mild to moderate difficulty psychological standpoint.  However, due to cultural differences it may well be that he under reports his level of distress in an effort to appear socially appropriate.  Dr. Yelsa opined that the patient is a good candidate for brief psychotherapy likely to address trauma issues and assist with coping.  However, there is no concern for poor psychological response, as per Dr. Yelsa.  \\n\\nColby Hansen, M.D. (University Orthopaedic Clinic)\\n\\nJuly 8, 2022 – Office visit note – The patient met with Dr. Tyser and his presentation was consistent with complex regional pain syndrome and he has been referred to the pain clinic for evaluation.  He was evaluated on July 6, 2022, and felt he met Budapest criteria for chronic regional pain syndrome.  He was recommended starting Gabapentin and scheduling a stellate ganglion block.  He has had a custom glove measured for him.  He would like to see the inflammation go down in his hand and work on range of motion with his intact digits before deciding how he would like to proceed from the standpoint of prosthesis intervention.  He is doing regular occupational hand therapy and has worked a lot on activities of daily living adaptations and he is incorporating it more into activities.  Physical examination: A comprehensive assessment musculoskeletal examination was done of the amputated and sound limbs.  Pertinent issues are amputation of left third digit to very proximal aspect of the proximal phalanx.  He continues to have fairly diffuse swelling in his left hand but getting a little more active range of motion, and he can almost oppose his thumb to his fifth digit and nearly obtain a pincher grasp.  Diagnosis: Traumatic amputation of digit of left hand.  Dr. Hansen states that he patient is beginning to work with hand therapy and making some progress but appears to have concomitant complex regional pain syndrome which treatment is just beginning to be put together.  He continues to have some adjustment issues but is starting to process this and does not wish to pursue formal counseling therapy.  He desires to utilize a prosthesis for both cosmetic and functional goals.  Dr. Hansen states that the patient has connected with another peer with an amputation which has been positive for him.  Plan: Continue aggressive hand therapy, continue pain clinic management of complex regional pain syndrome, reviewed Gabapentin, continue occupational therapy, advised to consider referral to outpatient social work at Nielsen Rehab Hospital, recommended custom compression therapy/effective edema control in left hand, advise to wear compression as directed by hand therapist, hold off prosthetic restoration until hand function is achieved, reevaluate passive and active device options from Handspring Prosthetics at next visit, and follow up in three months at multidisciplinary upper extremity amputee clinic. \\n\\nCarina Jackman, M.D. (University of Utah)\\n\\nJuly 14, 2022 – Procedure note – Preprocedure/postprocedure diagnoses: Complex regional pain syndrome type-1 of left upper extremity.

Mattingly, M.D. (Intermountain WorkMed - Orem)\\n\\nFebruary 27, 2020 – Independent medical evaluation – History of injury: Patient reports sustaining an injury at work on October 30, 2019. She was assigned to work at InPivota and was working as a machine operator on a machine that makes capsules. When they do a product change, they have to vacuum the area around the machine and on the day of the injury she was vacuuming behind a machine and was down on the floor when she came up and hit her head on the mixer part of a machine. She estimates that the mixer was about one to two feet above her when she was vacuuming.  She did not sustain a loss of consciousness, but felt slightly dizzy after the accident. She worked one to two more hours and was not feeling well. Her son was sick at home and her babysitter called and had to leave so she left work to tend to her sick son. The following day she called into Elwood Staffing and reported her symptoms and they had her come in and fill out an accident report and the following day on October 30, 2019 she was referred to the WorkMed Clinic.  At the WorkMed Clinic, she was diagnosed with a concussion. They had her off work for a few days and had her continue to follow-up on a regular basis. They recommended some physical therapy and eventually referred her to a Concussion Clinic. She had not yet started the therapy at WorkMed before her referral to a Concussion Clinic.  At the Concussion Clinic, she was diagnosed with a post-concussion syndrome and was treated by several different doctors including Dr. Campbell. She was referred to physical therapy and has been attending twice weekly since November of 2019 and they are working mainly on her neck. They tried some trigger point injections which helped for a few days but then made her symptoms worse. At her last visit with the Concussion Clinic, they talked about having her see a pain specialist for Botox injections. They also referred her for a brain MR, which is scheduled to be done on February 28, 2020. Overall, she feels about 50% improved since the injury first happened but is still having significant symptoms.\\n\\nChief complaints: Patient rates her average pain level as 7/10. She reports pain in her neck radiating into the right shoulder. She has numbness and tingling in both hands, all five digits, but this has only been present since her recent trigger point injection. She gets a migraine headache on a daily basis that will last anywhere from a few hours to all day long. She has some associated dizziness and blurred vision with migraines. She notes that her headaches are worse when she is exposed to cold air. She reports some difficulty sleeping. She does report symptoms of anxiety and depression that she feels have worsened since the work injury.  Past medical history: She was diagnosed with depression and anxiety about two and half years ago.  She was treated at Mountain Lands Community Health Center and was on Sertraline and BuSpar for about a year and has been off to these medications for about the last year and a half.  Past surgical history: Removal of ovarian cyst and tubal ligation in 2011, C-sections in 2002, 2006, 2009 and 2011, removal of right ovary in 2013.\\n\\nPhysical exam: She has minimal tenderness over the right paracervical musculature.  Cervical range of motion flexion 45°, extension 55°, right and left lateral flexion 40°, right lateral rotation 45°.  Shoulder range of motion abduction 180°, adduction 50°, forward flexion 180°, extension 50°, internal and external rotation 90°.  Elbow range of motion flexion 160°, extension 0°, pronation and supination 90°.  Wrist range of motion flexion 90°, extension 70°, radial deviation 20° and ulnar deviation 55°.\\n\\nSummary/impression: Patient reports developing symptoms after bumping her head on a machine at work on October 30, 2019. She was bent over doing some vacuuming and stood up one to two feet when she bumped her head on a machine adjacent to her. She did not sustain a loss of consciousness. She was evaluated at WorkMed two days after the accident and was diagnosed with a concussion without loss of consciousness and was prescribed amitriptyline. She followed-up on October 31, 2019 and was referred for a head CT which showed no evidence of acute intracranial abnormality.  She continued follow-up at WorkMed for approximately six weeks and attended physical therapy, but the notes from the physical therapist were not available at the time of this evaluation. She did not improve with the therapy, and was referred to the Concussion Clinic at Utah Valley Hospital. She has been treated by Dr. Campbell although records from treatment at the Concussion Clinic were also not available at the time of this evaluation.  This was a relatively mild mechanism of injury with patient simply standing up and bumping her head on a machine. The mechanism of injury is consistent with causing a mild traumatic brain injury.  She is now four months out from her injury and reports only 50% improvement and still has significant symptoms; however, her work-up has been largely unremarkable. Her current neurologic exam is completely normal and she had an MRI of the brain done on February 28, 2020 that was also completely normal.  With reasonable medical certainty, patient has stabilized from the effects of the work accident as of the date of this evaluation. This is more than reasonable healing time for a mild traumatic brain injury, especially given the very mild mechanism of injury. It is likely that her ongoing symptoms are unrelated to the work injury and due to preexisting conditions, including preexisting depression and anxiety.\\n\\nExaminer was asked some questions and the responses are as follows; patient simply bumped her head on a machine after standing up from vacuuming.  The current diagnosis is mild traumatic brain injury.  There are no objective findings to support that the patient sustained a mild traumatic brain injury. The mechanism of injury is consistent with causing at most a very mild traumatic brain injury that would have expected to have resolved within a few weeks to at most three months. She did not have any loss of consciousness, did not have any abnormal findings on neurologic exam. CT scan or MRI. She did not have any documented anterograde or retrograde amnesia or other findings concerning for more serious brain injury. The mechanism of injury would not be expected to result in anything more than a very mild traumatic brain injury which again should have resolved. She describes symptoms of anxiety and depression that are likely due to preexisting conditions and not the work accident.  The mechanism of injury is consistent with causing at most a very mild traumatic brain injury that should have resolved fairly quickly. The ongoing symptoms of the patient complains of are not likely causally related to the work injury. Her symptoms of anxiety and depression are likely due to preexisting anxiety and depression.  The mechanism of injury would be consistent with causing a mild temporary aggravation of preexisting depression and anxiety which should have resolved by this time. There are no objective findings to support the diagnosis of depression or anxiety. These are diagnoses based on symptoms.  The expected recovery from this injury to have occurred within a few weeks. The mechanism of injury is not consistent with causing symptoms that persist now months after her injury. Although all of the treatment she has received was directly related to the work injury, it is likely excessive given the mild mechanism of injury.  No further treatment is warranted with respect to the work injury.  No further physical limitations are warranted on an industrial basis. Patient is considered to be medically stable to return to unrestricted work as of the date of this report. Any further limitations, she feels she has in her ability to work would be due to preexisting/unrelated conditions and not the work injury.  Patient is considered to have reached maximum medical improvement as of the date of this evaluation. There is no objective evidence of permanent impairment due to the industrial injury.\\n\\nEmployer\\'s First Report of Injury or Illness\\n\\nNovember 7, 2022 – Incident report - While in the freezer grabbing a container of zucchini and putting it on the cart, Daniele Summers slipped and fell on her right knee and she injured multiple body parts on the right side.\\n\\nSean Biggs, M.D. (Intermountain WorkMed)\\n\\nNovember 7, 2022 – Physician\\'s initial report – History of injury: On November 7, 2022, patient was in the freezer with a coworker getting a big bin of zucchini, had the zucchini in her hands going to put it on the cart when she slipped in water and fell.

Lile, D.O.\\n\\nApril 7, 2023 – Initial evaluation – History of present illness: Patient sustained a workplace injury on November 7, 2022 when she slipped and fell while attempting to lift containers of zucchini with a coworker while at work. She was noted to have right knee and ankle pain as well as low back pain. She was initially evaluated and treated at Work Med and subsequently through Sports Medicine for her ankle and knee injuries which she notes have largely resolved. She was referred to Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation due to persistent low back pain which she notes has been fairly constant and consistent since her injury despite formal physical therapy, Naproxen and Robaxin. She was attempted to be prescribed Flexeril but this was difficult in getting approved through her Worker\\'s Compensation and she has subsequently not trialed it. She describes her back pain as constant and localizes it from her distal lumbar spine extending to about the level of T10. She describes her back discomfort as burning, numb and tingling, aching, sharp and stabbing. She admits to pain that radiates down her right lower extremity that feels somewhat numb and tingling. It stays largely in the posterior distribution of her lower leg and calf. Her left lower extremity she describes as numb, aching and burning and notes that that pain seems to run from the posterior thigh and even into the anterior aspect of her thigh down into the lower leg. She does admit to weakness somewhat diffusely in her bilateral legs as well as decreased sensation to her left lower extremity to a greater degree than her right. She notes that standing for prolonged periods as well as squatting, mopping, twisting and bending and even sitting worsen her symptoms. She has found some slight relief with heat while at physical therapy. She does note some additional numbness and tingling in her hands and arms that seems to have begun after her fall as well as some neck pain and additional radiating symptoms from her neck into her arms. She admits to a history of a prior concussion.  She feels that her back and associated symptoms are the most functionally limiting aspect of her pain or discomfort but does find her leg symptoms to be somewhat troublesome.  Physical exam: Musculoskeletal: Positive Spurling’s.  Formal strength assessment of her bilateral upper and lower extremities exhibited giveaway weakness through all cervical and lumbosacral myotomes that was somewhat inconsistent with her observed overall functionality, decreased sensation to the left lower extremity and left arm throughout essentially all cervical and lumbosacral dermatomes with preservation of thoracic dermatomes, 2+ symmetric reflexes, 4/5 Waddell’s signs positive.  Diagnoses: Numbness and tingling in both hands, neck pain, back pain, radiculopathy with lower extremity symptoms, and spasm of back muscles.  Plan: Ordered MRI of the cervical spine without contrast, continue formal physical therapy, prescribed Flexeril 10mg, Mobic 7.5mg, and Gabapentin 100mg.  Work status: Restrictions with lifting no more than 20 pounds and limiting twisting and bending.

He started having episode of vomiting and diarrhea intermittently over the past five days.  Father says that every other day he has been fine but today has again had a fairly severe increase as far as vomiting and diarrhea. He has had up to six loose bowel movements a day. The family is not aware of any blood in the bowel movements. He has vomited only once so far today per father’s report. That was after apparently consuming a Wendy’s hamburger, which he took in fairly well. At this point, he is not able to tolerate anything orally and he is complaining of severe abdominal pain. He complains now of abdominal pain that is localized in the middle upper part of his abdomen. He feels that his abdominal pain actually is somewhat improved after IV fluid boluses here in the Emergency Room. He is able to walk around the emergency room.  Physical exam: HEENT: His conjunctiva€ are somewhat dry and his eyes are somewhat sunken. Oropharynx: He has somewhat dry mucous membranes and his lips are cracked. Abdomen: Positive bowel sounds throughout. It is moderately distended throughout. He complains of tenderness in the midline.  Diagnosis: Probable gastroenteritis who is currently complaining of moderate abdominal and not tolerating oral fluids feedings well.  Plan: He is admitted for IV fluids and has already received a bolus in the Emergency Room. He will be at 125% maintenance fluids tonight and then will likely be started on clears. If his abdominal pain is not improved, he will have follow up films obtained or further imaging if indicated. He will have a stool study send including Rotazyme, stool cultures, Giardia, guaiac, reducing substances.

(Utah Valley Regional Medical Center)\\n\\nNovember 27, 2010 – Emergency department provider report – – History of present illness: Patient was brought in by Orem ambulance.  He was putting up Christmas lights when he slid off the roof, about 12 feet and landed down on his feet and then his buttocks and rolled to his back, complaining of back pain and left wrist pain.  Physical exam: Vital signs: Blood pressure 128/68, pulse 68, respirations 18, temperature 36, oxygen saturation 98% on room air.  Constitutional: No acute distress. He is in a cervical collar on a backboard. He was cleared off the backboard, has pain at his upper lumbar, no crepitus or step-offs, maintained in a cervical collar. HEENT: Normocephalic, atraumatic. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light. Extraocular muscles are intact. Nares patent. Oropharynx is clear. Neck: Soft, supple, trachea midline.  Respiratory: Clear to auscultation bilateral with no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi. Cardiovascular: S1, S2, no murmur, rub, or gallop. Abdomen: Soft and nontender. Musculoskeletal: The patient has tenderness to his lower thoracic, upper lumbar spine. He is distal neurovascularly intact. He has tenderness to palpation to the left wrist and also to the right ankle. He is maintained in log roll and positioned in a cervical collar.  Neurologic: The patient has no focal neurologic deficits. Psychiatric: The patient is alert and appropriate for age. Emergency department course: Patient with a possible spine fracture. CT scan of the thoracic and lumbar spine will be ordered. Cervical spine x-rays were ordered and also x-ray of the left wrist and right ankle. The CT scan demonstrated the patient has an L1 burst fracture. Discussed the case with Dr. Gaufin who has come down and saw the patient.  X-rays for the ankle show no signs of acute fracture and wrist demonstrates an ulnar styloid and distal radius fracture.  He was placed in a sugar-tong splint and posterior splint for the ankle sprain.  Dr. Bacon was consulted.  Diagnosis: L1 burst fracture, right wrist fracture, and right ankle sprain. Emergency department disposition: Patient will be admitted. \\n\\nLynn M. Gaufin, M.D. (Utah Valley Regional Medical Center)\\n\\nNovember 27, 2010 – History and physical report – History of present illness: Patient was on a ladder, apparently fall about 10 feet, landing on his buttocks and he had excruciating low back pain.  The pain was so intense that he was brought to the hospital by ambulance. Apparently, he was putting up Christmas lights and he fell off the roof, and he injured his ankle and wrists. In the emergency center, they did x-rays and they demonstrated a burst compression fracture of L1. He stated that he did not have any numbness and he could move his legs, although his right leg was a little weaker than the left.  Physical exam: Extremities: He has a swollen left wrist, has a surgical splint on it.  Apparently, there is a fracture of the wrist.  He also has a swollen right ankle.  Lower extremity strength is 4/5 on the left.  On the right lower extremity, he can flex the hip, ankle and knee but he states that he feels like there is a weakness in the right hip flexion.  He wants to lie supine, does not want to rotate from left to right.  Diagnoses: L1 burst compression fracture, fracture of left wrist, sprain of right ankle, and former history of heroin dependency. Plan: Discussed the modes of treatment for this type of fracture. One is to bed rest for three to six weeks and then a molded polypropylene body cast for twelve weeks. The other mode is to go in and do surgery, placing some titanium screws into the pedicles and fuse a posterior lateral fusion, and then he needs to wear a molded polypropylene body cast for, again about twelve weeks.  Went over with them the positives and negatives of each of those types of treatment. He would like at this point to temporize on surgery, thinking that he would like to consider bed rest and body cast as his first choice at this moment.  He is desirous of having narcotics and some Valium for anxiety and muscle relaxant, proceed accordingly.  Pain management consult, bed rest, measured for a molded polypropylene body cast and ordered CT scan of the cervical spine as per radiology recommendation. \\n\\nRoy C.

He landed on his back. He was brought to the emergency room, where he was found to have L1 burst fracture, left radial and ulnar fractures, and sprained right ankle. He has been at bed rest since, and is anticipating surgery tomorrow.  He indicates he has been seen overnight to have periods of hypertension.  At time, his diastolic blood pressure was as high as 115. This is up and down, the trend is somewhat today.  There has been a concern of possible withdrawal symptoms. He is a significant alcohol user. He indicates he drinks several beers a day, and much more on weekends. He has had a history of heroin abuse and is withdrawn from heroin. He indicates that he does not think he is withdrawn currently, and is not confused in any way, but is very anxious.  He indicates he has significant anxiety issues. He has attention deficit hyperactivity disorder as well as mild obsessive-compulsive disorder. Lying on bed, he cannot stop thinking about all the possible bad outcomes in his current situation. He is also worried about finances, family, and of course surgery. He believes is the cause of his blood pressure issues.  He is on Valium 5 mg IV for muscle spasms at this time.  He had right wrist surgery related to a snowmobile accident.  Physical exam: Extremities: Splint on his left wrist and he also has a dressing on his right ankle. Diagnoses: Multiple trauma, with L1 burst fracture, left wrist fracture and right ankle sprain, hypertension, largely due to anxiety as it goes up and down when he is more anxious and will attempt to better control his anxiety, and then add in antihypertensives as needed, rule out withdrawal syndrome and does not think he shows evidence of withdrawal at this time, although the Valium may be blunting some of that response and will monitor closely for that, and history of heroin abuse. Plan: Increase his Valium to 10 mg, added antihypertensive if needed if the Valium is not adequate.  He is stable at this time and certainly appropriate for surgery tomorrow.  \\n\\nLynn M.

He fell from a roof while hanging Christmas lights and had a burst fracture. He was fused of T12, L1 and L2. He has recovered well over the year.  Physical Exam:  He does feel his back changes when the weather changes.  Plan: He continues on some pain medicine and he has slowly decreased that over time. He has always been very compliant with it. He is going to continue exercising, continue walking. Planning to put him at maximum medical improvement. He is going to go to Dr. Leininger for impairment rating.  Refilled his pain medication.  Follow up in two months.  \\n\\nKirk W. Leininger, M.D. (Physical Med and Rehab-AF)\\n\\nDecember 29, 2011 – Impairment rating note – History of present illness: Patient was injured on November 28, 2010. He was working for a company that did concrete lifting and helical piers. On the day of injury, he was up on the roof of the office decorating for Christmas. He fell 12 feet from the roof onto the hard ground below and landed on his left ankle and left wrist and then fell to his buttocks. He sprained the left ankle and fractured the left wrist with a very slight distal ulna and radius fracture. He also sustained a burst fracture at L1. Initially, he was taken to the hospital by ambulance on a backboard. It was in the emergency department that the x-rays and CT scans revealed the above injuries. He had a consultation with neurosurgery regarding the burst fracture at L1. He was felt to be unstable. He opted for the surgical decompression and fusion from T12-L2 done by Dr. Lynn Gaufin without complication. He wore a TLSO for several months after the surgery. He recovered well from the surgery itself, but did have an episode of skin breakdown on the lowest portion of the incision scar from how the brace is rubbing on his back. That was treated by wound care without any long-term impact. He did postoperative physical therapy. He has been left with some chronic back pain that is being managed by his surgeon’s office.  He also was treated for the left wrist fracture with splinting initially until the swelling came down and he was casted for six weeks. He had a complete recovery from the wrist fracture with no long-term problems.  The ankle sprain was treated conservatively and resolved within a matter of weeks.\\n\\nChief complaint: He describes the pain as being constant 6/10 aching and stabbing and a sense of numbness as the low back and down the left leg.  On a good day, pain may be as low as 4/10 and on a bad day may be as intense as 8/10. He is never pain free. He always has more pain if he does any prolonged sitting or standing. It also hurts to bend, twist or if he lies down for a long time. He feels best he can walk around and use heat on the back. Pain medications also help.  He also feels like the left leg is slightly weaker than the right.  Past medical history: History of heroin abuse.  He has been clean for several years.\\n\\nPhysical exam: Back Lumbar flexion is limited to about 25° with some pain. Lumbar extension is about 15° with pain.  Lateral bending shows most movement above the T12 level and almost no movement in the lumbar region. He is very tender over the incision scar and bilateral paraspinal muscles from T11-L3. He is also sensitive to palpation in the let posterior pelvis.  Lower Extremities: Strength in the left leg is generally 5-/5. There is slight weakness on the left compared to the right. Straight leg raising is negative up to 70° bilaterally. He does have some sensitivity to touch on the left upper inner thigh, that is not present on the rest of the leg.  Neurological: Sensation is slightly hypersensitive in the left upper inner thigh and left upper posterior thigh. Impression: L1 burst fracture without spinal cord injury, it was treated with surgery to decompress the spine and diffuse it from T12-L2. He had adequate decompression with restoration of normal anatomic position. He has been left with some chronic back pain and some neurogenic pain down the left leg. He also has a general sense of weakness in the left ag that in not myotomal and suspect that the mild weakness in the left leg is more associated with probable nerve imitation with the initial injury. He has gotten as much recovery as he will get from this injury, left wrist fracture affecting distal radius and ulna, he also had a complete resolution of his left radius and ulna fracture without any residual pain or loss of function or range of motion, left ankle sprain, he had a complete resolution of the left ankle sprain without any residual loss of function and no residual pain.  Disability status: He has been declared at maximum medical improvement as of November 28, 2011. Impairment rating: 17% whole person impairment for the lumbar spine.  There is no impairment rating for the left wrist fracture and left ankle sprain as it has healed well.  Work restrictions: He has been given permanent work restrictions, including maximum of 30 pounds. He should avoid prolonged sitting or prolonged standing during his schooling and during his eventual career. He is currently involved in vocational retraining and is working with a vocational rehabilitation counselor and has supported this decision.  Causation: Related to work-related injury on November 26, 2010.  Follow up with his surgeon for tapering off of his pain medications, support the tapering off his opioids, because of his history of previous substance abuse and for pain management of the neurogenic pain, would consider use of Neurontin or Lyrica. \\n\\nLynn M.

Corey, M.D. (Utah Valley Regional Medical Center)\\n\\nAugust 26, 2013 – MRI of lumbar spine without and with contrast – Impression: Uncomplicated appearance of the fusion from T12-L2. Mild wedging of the L1 vertebral body, chronic in appearance.  There is congenital mildly shortened pedicles with narrowing of the number spinal canal at L3 and L4. There is mild degenerative disc disease and facet hypertrophy at L4-5, which in combination with the congenital narrowing is causing moderate right-sided neuroforaminal narrowing. Mild to moderate left-sided neuroforaminal narrowing at L5-S1. Mildly thickened fatty filum, likely incidental given the normal termination of the conus medullaris at L1.  \\n\\nStephen Douglas, M.D. (Utah Valley Regional Medical Center)\\n\\nSeptember 18, 2013 – X-ray of lumbosacral spine two or three views – Impression: Stable appearance of a prior T12-L2 thoracolumbar fusion with compression fracture of L1. \\n\\nLynn M.

Return to clinic in three months. \\n\\nSpencer Heaton, M.D. (Wasatch Sports, Spine and Pain Treatment Center)\\n\\nMarch 19, 2014 – History and physical – History of present illness: Patient had an unfortunate accident a few years ago in which he was working on a roof stringing light and slipped and fell, landing initially on his feet and then falling onto his buttock and back. He sustained an L1 burst fracture as well as a left L1 laminar fracture with symptoms at that time described as extreme axial back pain at the site of the injury as well as shooting pains predominantly down the posterior aspect of the left leg. He also felt at that time that his left leg was weaker than the right, but he was confined to bed and was not able to objectively measure the strength of his lower extremities. Other injuries sustained that time included a left wrist fracture and right ankle sprain.  He underwent a lumbar spine fusion from T12-12 as well as surgical repair of his upper extremity fracture. His course since that time has been complicated by chronic pain in his low back at the area of the injury/fusion as well as the gradual development of progressive pain in the region of the spine immediately cephalad and caudad to the fusion. He currently describes the pain at the area of the fusion as a constant, dull, throbbing and aching pain without significant variability but with some improvement noted with physical activity and an aggravation of pains with prolonged sitting or lying down in the same position. The pain just above and below the surgical site is experienced as more of a sharp sensation and is brought on frequently by bending and twisting, especially spine extension and rotation. This pain is also for the most part aggravated by prolonged sitting and in general by being more sedentary and is improved by physical activity. This is frustrating for the patient since immediately during periods of physical activity his pain is worse but he feels that it is a necessary part of his recovery and definitely notices improvement on a long-term basis. He reports a very responsible approach to his chronic pain conditions with a focus on long-term benefit through dedicated and consistent physical activity despite the temporary pain.  Although his primary pain in the back is described as being located around the spine itself and the adjacent musculature, he also reports sensitivity to touch and cold temperature throughout a large area of his back, worse on the left than the right. His wife reports that ever since his traumatic injury he does not let anyone to rub his back, since that is a very unpleasant and painful experience for him. Gabapentin has been the most alleviating treatment for that specific pain.  He also reports similar skin sensitivity and pain throughout his medial thighs, perineum and genitalia. These symptoms involving the medial aspect of his thighs are constant and described as an \"itchy and electrical\" feeling. The same discomfort is noticed intermittently in his genitalia a few times a month and typically resolves spontaneously by the next day. Although, he has a significantly decreased libido he does not report physiologic sexual dysfunction. These particular painful symptoms are aggravated by walking, touch and cold temperature and are somewhat alleviated by Gabapentin.  He also reports intermittent electrical shooting pain sometimes accompanied by a sensation of numbness/tingling in the left posterior lower extremity. Below the knee, the symptoms extend from the posterior region to include the medial aspect of the lower leg and terminate throughout the ankle and the medial aspect of the foot. Although, he describes these symptoms as intermittent.  He does admit on specific questioning that there is at least some abnormal skin sensation and/or discomfort constantly but compared to his other painful problems it is not of significant concern or distress except at the times of intermittent exacerbation, which is typically unpredictable as far as aggravating triggers. Rest and pain medications are his only alleviating factors.  He does report subjective weakness in his left lower extremity at times without discrete motor deficits. After his surgery a few years ago, he participated in physical therapy and since that time he has tried to be as active as possible with home exercise, but he has not returned for any physical therapy treatment in the last few years. He takes 600mg of Gabapentin three times a day and definitely notices that it helps with his paresthesia/dysesthesias. He also takes Meloxicam 15mg daily and has done so for quite a while so he is not really sure of its efficacy since he does not know what he would feel like if he stopped it. After a full day at work, he tends to have aggravation of his back pain and so he takes two Percocet 7.5/320 and five in the evening every day. He also takes Tramadol 50mg on average two times per day. Lastly, he rotates back and forth between Soma 350mg and Diazepam 10mg to help ease muscle tightness and aid in sleep. He has been prescribed 15mg Soma and 20mg Diazepam per month. All of these medications have been prescribed by Dr. MacArthur. Of note, he has a previous history of Heroin misuse. It was a short period of time in his remote past. Past medical history: Gastroesophageal reflux, generalized anxiety disorder, headache, migraine, osteoarthritis, ankle and foot, and traumatic head injury.  Past surgical history: Hand open reduction internal fixation, lumbar fusion and rhinoplasty.\\n\\nPhysical exam: Patient has an area of allodynia and hyperalgesia on the left side of his back extending from midline laterally approximately 10cm with a cephalad border at approximately 17 and a caudad border essentially at the upper buttock. To some extent similar sensory abnormalities are identified on the right side of his back but to a lesser degree. Allodynia and hyperalgesia are also noted throughout the medial thigh extending proximally to the caudad termination of the inguinal crease. Vibratory sense is \"more intense\" throughout the left S1 and S2 dermatomes, 4+/5 strength with left dorsiflexion and plantar flexion. He struggles to do rise on his toes and heels bilaterally on the left compared to the right; patellar reflexes are 2+ bilaterally and Achilles reflexes are 1+ on the right and minimally present on the left.  Musculoskeletal: Range of motion throughout the lumbar spine is moderately limited in forward flexion with pain aggravation experienced during return to standing straight. Lumbar/thoracic extension is severely limited due to reproduction of concordant pain both immediately above and below his surgical incision site. This pain is aggravated with concurrent lateral rotation/pending in a concordant fashion. Lumbar paraspinous tenderness is present most prominently from L2 through S1. Deep palpation over facet joints L2-3, L3/L4, L4/L5 and L5-S1 reproduces concordant axial low back pain and is poorly tolerated by the patient. Similarly immediately cephalad to his surgical incision, he has thoracic paraspinous muscle tenderness that extends from T11 to approximately T7. Similar to the lumbar spine, the underlying facet joints from T7-T11 are very tender with deep palpation reproducing concordant pain that is poorly tolerated by the patient. His surgical scar is well-healed the overlying area is somewhat tender but less so than the previously described lower thoracic and lower lumbar areas. Palpation over the sacroiliac joint revealed tenderness bilaterally with Faber\\'s test reproducing pain in the low back/buttock. Straight leg raise test is positive on the left for S1 and S2 dermatomal radicular pain.\\n\\nAssessment: Fracture of lumbar vertebra, closed, lumbar degenerative disc disease, lumbar spondylosis (without myelopathy), post-laminectomy syndrome; lumbar region, illoinguinal neuralgia, lumbar radiculitis, myofascial pain, and chronic opioid use for pain management.  Plan: Discontinue Percocet and prescribed Butrans patch 10mcg/hr and increase to 15-20mcg/hr, continue Soma, Diazepam, high-dose gabapentin at night and even supplemental use of Melatonin.  He is an excellent candidate for neuromodulation through spinal cord stimulation.  It is appropriate to emphasize and reiterate that MBRFA is a very operator dependent procedure with extremes in outcome measures seen based on procedural technique and patient selection.  \\n\\nToran J.
